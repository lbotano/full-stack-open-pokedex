I chose Java for this exercise, since I'm somewhat familiar with it.

# Linting
There are multiple tools that for linting but with different purposes.
* *SpotBugs*:
As its name suggests, is used to find bugs in Java code, from simple things as dropping exceptions, to security vulnerabilities.
* *Chekstyle*:
Checks for coding style (indentation, variable naming conventions, maximum line length, etc.)

Both of these tools can be integrated with Ant, Gradle, Maven or Eclipse.

# Testing
JUnit is the most used framework for unit testing in Java.
# Building
The three most used build tools for Java are Ant, Gradle and Maven. However, they can be used with other languages as well.

# CI
Jenkins and Github Actions are very used tools for CI, but not the only ones.
* *Gitlab CI/CD*:
It's arguably more mature than its somewhat new competitor, GitHub Actions. Although some may say it's less intuitive.
* *Bitbucket*:
It's a service for managing and hosting repositories. It supports pipelines, Git operations, documentation, issue tracking, wikis, static sites and more. There are free plans for open source projects and non-profit organizations.
Its source code is accessible to customers.
* *Buildkite*:
Service that offers build pipelines and testing for projects. It's free for students and open-source projects, and there are fixed prices for commercial use.
* *Circle CI*:
It's a CI tool that can be integrated with several services. It has cloud and server plans.

# About the exercise
A cloud-based environment would be more convenient for a small team of 6 people, since its cost usually depends on build time and team members.
